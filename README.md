A sample project that supports CRUD operations on appointments from Microsoft Exchange via EWS.

Frontend is Angular (PrimeNG) and Spring Boot. Backend is Spring Boot. Redis is used for caching.

There is only support for EWS so you will need a on premise Exchange server to use it. 

The project does not support Office 365 (Microsoft Graph is not supported for on premise installations). Either a Office 365 or a hybrid installation is needed for that.

I hope it can be of help to someone.
